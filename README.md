# Indoor navigation system

This a Flutter application.

Project idea is to locate user’s position inside indoor areas where GPS doesn’t work.
The application can:
- detect/locate the user’s position on the map (floor plan map of the place) equivalent to their current location on reality. 
- select user's position manually.
- Display pin marks that denotes the destinations to go on the map. 
- The user selects one of the destination marks.
- generate the shortest route where the user can navigate through.
